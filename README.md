## Production build

To run this application locally with a production build, run:

1.  `npm run build`
2.  `npm run start`

## Tests

### Linting and unit tests

We have linting with the [Airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and we use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) as a code formatter. They can be run with `npm run test:lint`.

We have [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) unit tests that can be run with `npm run test:unit`.

`npm test` runs both sets of these.

### End-to-end tests

We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for our end-to-end tests.
`npm run test:e2e` This will run the application and the Cypress tests. After tests are run, it will stop all Razzle processes (we use Razzle for our application).

Tests can also be run in isolation like this `npm run test:e2e -- --spec cypress/integration/article_spec.js`.
Further details on using the Cypress CLI can be found at https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html

Cypress can be run interactively using `npm run test:e2e:interactive`. This loads a user interface which easily allows for indivdual tests to be run alongside a visual stream of the browser, as the tests run.
